Wbxml : tiny Haskell library for WBXML processing

        http://github.com/limansky/wbxml

    This library provides API for parsing and generating WBXML format
    (see http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml/ to get more information).

    WBXML Tables definition is created based on libwbxml 0.11 sources
    (see http://libwbxml.opensync.org/).

    Current status of this project is early development.  So the API is
    not stabilized, not all WBXML features are supported.  Please contact
    me in case you are going to use it in real project.
